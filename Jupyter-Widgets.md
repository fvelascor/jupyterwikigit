Jupyter Widgets is a system for providing interactive JavaScript controls for objects in a Jupyter kernel.

Here are some helpful resources about Jupyter widgets and where they are supported. These unofficial lists are maintained by the community at large in hopes they will be helpful. Listing here does not imply endorsement by Project Jupyter. These lists are certainly not comprehensive. Feel free to edit this page to include or update relevant information.

## Custom Jupyter Widgets

Beyond the basic form controls (sliders, checkboxes, text inputs, date/color pickers, etc.) and containers (tabs, horizontal/vertical boxes, grids) provided by the core [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/) project, there are many projects providing custom interactive widgets. Here we list a few. In addition to the projects below, you may also find custom Jupyter Widgets in the [jupyter-widgets GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/jupyter-widgets).
